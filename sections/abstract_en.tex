	This paper investigates the extension of Montgomery algorithm to finite fields. By constructing isomorphic mappings, we extend the traditional Montgomery modular multiplication algorithm to polynomial ring operations over finite field $\mathrm{GF}(p^k)$. We propose optimized finite field multiplication methods based on the REDC algorithm, including bit-level and word-level implementations. Experimental results show that the improved algorithm significantly enhances computational efficiency and reduces resource consumption, making it particularly suitable for large-scale finite field operations in cryptography and coding theory.(Given by AI)
